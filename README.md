This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a React version of the game Yahtzee. It is in the early stages of development, and this README will be updated to reflect new additions as and when they are made.

Currently the dice can be rolled, any dice which the player wants to retain across rolls can be selected and the turn can be advanced after 3 rolls. Scores are calculated according to the results of each roll and added to the player's score card. The player can choose which category to mark the score under and a running total of the score is calculated after each turn. Bonuses for multiple Yahtzees are still to be added.

Styling is handled using react-bootstrap, although is still very basic at this point.

The next stage is adding support for multiplayer games.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a React version of the game Yahtzee. It is in the early stages of development, and this README will be updated to reflect new additions as and when they are made.

Currently the dice can be rolled, any dice which the player wants to retain across rolls can be selected and the turn can be advanced after 3 rolls. The next stage will be to implement scoring.
